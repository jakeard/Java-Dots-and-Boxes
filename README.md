# Overview

This is my **Java Dots and Boxes** software. I decided to make this game to learn about Java, and to showcase my understanding of it from my research and practice. 

This is the Dots and Boxes game that you are (hopefully) familiar with (if not, then give it a try!). From researching and practicing with Java, I made this game to work with and make sure that I understand the language and its syntax at a basic level.
